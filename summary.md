## Summary

We, as a group, have decided to build a Study/Work Management Extension. The extension is divided into various aspects to help people study or work in a more controlled environment to maximize efficiency. 

* Have background capabilities to allow the user to customize his background noises to create a more ambient sound, such as rain, coffee shop, thunder, hip hop mix, etc.
* Allow users to study with different backgrounds fitting to the aesthetic they find the most comfortable
* Anime, Bookstore, Coffee Shop
* Have a Pomodoro timer to keep track of study 
* Automatic screen dimmer depending on the time of day, creates less strain on the eyes, similar to flux on Windows.
* Have a simple quick note taker on the side for quick ideas. 
* Restricts webpage to full-screen mode to hide other distractions?
* It shall have cooldowns such as stopping the extension for a certain period of time, allowed by the user, and disabling it. You will have to do a small (not hard) math problem
* Have emergency notifications turn on for specific contacts such as a boss, mom, etc.
* Every time you try to go onto a website on your blacklist, it shall show a motivational quote and recommended websites you should be working on

It is mainly aimed at students but can be used by people working from home to have a more controlled study/work environment. I think they will find the software valuable because it will help them study habits. Home is a more convenient but very distracting environment. Thus, this will be for those who can’t go to a coffee shop to also have that same environment at home.

#### Components
We are planning to build it with React.js. Some components will be built around what we want the extension to do.
* Background picker
* Pomodoro timer
* Background noises
* Website Restrictions
* Screen Dimmer

The anticipated challenge is having some of us learn to react that haven’t worked on it before. We are planning to divide the work based on experience. For example, a team leader has experience with React.js, and the least experienced should build the simplest components. Time management is probably the biggest obstacle we will probably come across.

#### User Stories
* Student: a student looking to study at home
* WFH: a worker working from home that needs to focus on work
* Person: who needs to study for a future assignment that is not based on work or school but is needed to expand their knowledge.
  * For example, a person learning to code for fun or as a hobby.
