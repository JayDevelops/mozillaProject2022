The strengths we have in the group is David Pablo is already learning
React, and Jay Perez knows a little bit about React language. On the
contrary, Rhazin Khan and Luis Ayala Saldivar will have to dedicate some
time to learning React to get the project going. Some schedule conflicts
we may encounter is having only Fridays available to work on the
project, and we may have to dedicate some time on the weekends to meet
some deadlines we will place on ourselves. We will host our meetings
online on Friday at around 6:30 pm and dedicate Luis Ayala Saldivar to
taking meeting minutes/notes. We will make decisions on a majority vote
and list it under our meeting notes. Also, we will contribute all of our
code on a GitHub repo under different branches.
